Dependencies
------------
To install the livewires package, you must first install Python. To 
use the livewires package, you must first install pygame.


Installation
------------
First, extract the livewires_package folder to your hard drive. You 
cannot install LiveWires directly from the CD-ROM. Next, from the 
livewires_package folder, run the setup.bat file by double-clicking 
it. If you get a message that Python can't be found, you may need 
to update your PATH to include the folder in which you installed 
Python.


Testing
-------
Start the Python interpreter and type:

from livewires import games, color

If this line produces no errors, you've successfully installed the 
package. If you get an error that refers to pygame, you may not have 
successfully installed pygame. pygame is required to use livewires.
